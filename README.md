Quick attempt at getting Firebase authenticated user info from client to server.

# Installation
Clone, npm install. You'll need a .json file with your Firebase credentials (which you can download from the Firebase console and set in the `serviceAccount` in `server.js`) and a FIREBASE_URL env var (which you can also get from the Firebase console).
